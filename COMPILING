To compile WASTE, you must use Visual C++ .NET 2003 (7.1) or Visual C++ .NET (7.0),
however the older .NET is officially unsupported at this time, as well as any newer
Visual C++ version which may exist.

Compiling using Visual C++:
---------------------------

To compile WASTE in Visual C++ .NET 2003, edit build\Version to reflect the build and
version number you wish, then run Inc.bat. After this has completed, open WASTE.vcproj
and Build the solution.

To compile WASTE in Visual C++ .NET, follow the same instructions above, except
replacing WASTE.vcproj.7 with WASTE.vcproj.

Compiling using SDK (free):
---------------------------

WASTE can also be compiled using a custom setup environment using the free Visual C++
tools provided at various times by Microsoft. Unfortunately we cannot provide these
files as they are copyrighted material. To build WASTE, follow instructions above,
excepting the last step, where you must open a console and run "ZWinMake.bat", which
will run nmake for you and build the project.

To acquire the SDK, follow the following instructions:

Download and install the Visual C++ Toolkit 2003:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/vctoolkit2003/

Download and install the Windows Server 2003 SP1 Platform SDK:
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=A55B6B43-E24F-4EA3-A93E-40C0EC4F68E5&displaylang=en

You may also need the MASM package.

You must then configure your environment and possibly copy a few files between the two,
it seems partially system depended, so your mileage may vary. Provided the environment
is setup right, this will allow full compilation capabilities, and WASTE should build fine.

Building WASTE Server (for Windows):
------------------------------------

To build WASTE server, open WASTESrv.vcproj for .NET 2003, or WASTESrv.vcproj.7 for .NET.
